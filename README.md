# words

A simple application I built to get familiar with Elm. The backend is in flask (Python).

## Usage

1. Run the command ```elm-package install``` in the ```frontend``` directory
2. Run ```start.sh``` in the project root


## Elm resources

* [elm-live](https://github.com/architectcodes/elm-live) for rapid prototyping
* [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format) for sanity
